"""CLEAR CLEAN ESN"" Sprint EPIC 4G Galaxy SPH-D700*FRONT CAMERA*ANDROID*SLIDER*QWERTY KEYBOARD*TOUCH SCREEN",Samsung,199.99,5,"I originally was using the Samsung S2 Galaxy for Sprint and wanted to return back to the Samsung EPIC 4G for Sprint because I really missed the keyboard, I really liked the smaller compact size of the phone, and I still needed some of the basic functions of a smart phone (i.e. checking e-mail, getting directions, text messaging) Because the phone is not as powerful as the newer cell phones out there, just be aware that the more applications you install the slower the phone runs and will most likely freeze up from time to time. But the camera works great, the video is great as well, and even the web browsing is decent and gives me what I need. I also notice that battery life lasts a little bit longer and charging the phone is much quicker than my Galaxy S2.",0

"""CLEAR CLEAN ESN"" Sprint EPIC 4G Galaxy SPH-D700*FRONT CAMERA*ANDROID*SLIDER*QWERTY KEYBOARD*TOUCH SCREEN",Samsung,199.99,1,I'm really disappointed about my phone and service. The phone went out on me over a week ago. Instead of handling it when issue first surfaced. I've been told to do this and do that. Now I'm stick with no phone and I'm out 55 dollars for service that I'm not using. I still haven't received a mailing label to return item. This was my first purchase on amazon. I'm not rushing to use theirs or smartphones 288 business Anytime soon. I thought I was getting a deal but it seems like I'm the one who lucked out.,1
"""CLEAR CLEAN ESN"" Sprint EPIC 4G Galaxy SPH-D700*FRONT CAMERA*ANDROID*SLIDER*QWERTY KEYBOARD*TOUCH SCREEN",Samsung,199.99,5,Ordered this phone as a replacement for the same model until my contract expires and I can get a new one.

"""CLEAR CLEAN ESN"" Sprint EPIC 4G Galaxy SPH-D700*FRONT CAMERA*ANDROID*SLIDER*QWERTY KEYBOARD*TOUCH SCREEN",Samsung,199.99,1,I purchased this phone in December as a christmas present to my son. I called sprint to activate the phone only to find out the ESN wasn't clear. I was told to come into the store and upon research the phone wasn't clear. I reached out to this company to inform them that this ESN wasn't clean. I was told to send the phone back and they would send out another phone. I asked the representative to provide me with the ESN # so that I could call and make sure it was clear. I was told that they didn't have to phone available and was guaranteed it would be clear. I should've known something was wrong then. I received a second phone that turned out not have a clear ESN. The representative at Sprint informed me that the seller of these phones are aware the the ESN isn't clear. So once again I had to send another phone back. I asked for a refund for the phone and shipping since the sent me two phones that didn't have a clear ESN. I received my refund for the phone but have yet to see a refund for the shipping. I wouldn't suggest you buy anything from them.,19

"""Nokia Asha 302 Unlocked GSM Phone with 3.2MP Camera, Video, QWERTY Keyboard, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, FM Radio, SNS Integration, MP3/MP4 Player and microSD Slot - White International Version/Warranty",Nokia,299,5,"Bought this as an alternative to a smart phone and data plan. I use it with Go-Phone on a pay-as-you-go plan. The phone functions are great. The radio and music players are very good sound quality. The smart phone type features are easier and faster to use than any smart phone I have used. There are some software glitches that are documented on the Nokia support site which proved easily fixed. Even though many of the Nokia based features are no longer supported by Microsoft, you can still use the features needed by accessing the web directly via WIFI connection - or data if you want to pay for the privilege - and launching the site/application from there. Although the new Nokia browser is pretty Spartan in appearance, it is fast and runs with good stability. I am a very big guy with lands large even for my size and I find the full qwerty keyboard to be pretty easy to use. I like the programmable hot keys and on-screen shortcuts. Keeps you from launching items that require data connections by accident. The back lighting is thorough and even and the raised buttons are tactile with a positive click response. The phone does have a few quirks. There is no airplane mode as far as I can tell. The flight profile doesn't seem to be able to be set with the broadcasting and receiving functions turned off. The main navigation button/mouse is a little small and doesn't always respond as expected - that might be me though. All in all I would recommend this phone and vendor highly if you want the features of a smart phone but you don't need GPS or a big data bill every month for a bunch of things you don't need or want to keep you life running smoothly.",1
