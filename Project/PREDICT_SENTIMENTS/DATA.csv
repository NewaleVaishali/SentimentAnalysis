Phoenix Cloud,Enterprise,"It was a pleasure and a relief. In addition to assisting me with my issues, I am also able to learn more about the product. Tech has a great understanding.",
Phoenix Cloud,Enterprise,Excellent product and excellent support!,
Endpoints,EP,Abdulkadir Lokhandwala was a pleasure to work with and an excellent resource. I give him the highest of recommendations.,

Phoenix Cloud,Enterprise,Mr. Kislay did a great job in not only monitoring progress of the ticket and issue but also offered a solution that would achieve exactly what we were looking for.,
Phoenix Cloud,Enterprise,Giri responded well and resolved the issue quickly,
inSync Cloud,EP,Sometimes it seems the technician is really just focused on closing the case and not really helping solve the problem I have.,
inSync Cloud,EP,Gr8,
Phoenix Cloud,Enterprise,"Great feedback: 1. very short time to get issue ticket created 2. very short time for response 3. once contacted my issue was resolved quickly, in this case it my lack of knowledge",
inSync Cloud,EP,I've been working with Druva for years and the support team has always supported very quickly and takes the time to listen and explain. I'm very satisficed with Druva as a product and their services!,
inSync Cloud,EP,Excelent product and support team,
inSync Cloud,EP,"Rohit, the person who helped me was super competent and very friendly. He fully answered all of my questions, and figured out some difficult details for my particular problem. I am super impressed by Rohit's capability, and you should be proud to have him on your staff. He made my experience with Druva support a painless and happy experience. You don't usually get that in a support related encounter. Thanks Rohit!",
inSync Cloud,EP,Keep up the good work!,
inSync Cloud,EP,"On this particular day, trying access support was very difficult. There were certainly major issues with the Druva phone system. Druva support tried to contact me and the line would drop or I could not hear the Druva tech. Even trying to open a new ticket was very frustrating due to unstable Druva phone system.",
inSync Cloud,EP,Excellent Support,
inSync Cloud,EP,"Druva Insync is great, has saved multiple of my users from losing their information. Great product easy to use, great support",
Endpoints,EP,Our USMT backups and restores were down almost the entire week due to a python upgrade that you guys made in the backend. The support engineers were great but your processes for support are terrible. An outage like this should have been prioritized and I shouldn't have had to wait for someone to start their shift to have my ticket worked on. The next person arriving for their shift should have taken the ticket to continue working. We literally had to pause our entire project for days because of this issue. The USMT backup process has been a nightmare every time we need to update the config files. It would be great if we can be contacted by corporate because there was a lot of time wasted by myself working with support to try and get the issue resolved and my company which was not able to continue our project.,
inSync On-Premise,EP,"You're doing an excellent job Team, Keep rocking, All the best",
Phoenix Cloud,Enterprise,"Great support from Harish, even on a Saturday! Thank you for your quick call back and resolution. First in class tech support!!",
inSync Cloud,EP,"Today, I worked with Mahesh Kadu from Druva support to assist us setting up the integration between Azure AD and Insync on-cloud. Mahesh have responded to the open case in a timely manner, called us on time as we agreed, and was able to fix setup mistakes/issues. During the session, Mahesh have demonstrated excellent knowledge and skill to understand and solve the issue. As usual, we are very happy and satisfied with the support level we've been getting from Druva team over the years. Many thanks",
Phoenix Cloud,Enterprise,Working with Druva Tech Support is always a pleasure. Technicians are always very knowledgeable and professional. THANKS!,
Phoenix Cloud,Enterprise,Nice solution but it's hard to move from full application aware (veeam) to just backup when I have exchange mailboxes and AD to restore on occasion.,
inSync Cloud,EP,Umesh Choudhary helped me on my call and he was fantastic!,
Phoenix Cloud,Enterprise,"Druva Tech Support is the best. I have never had any complaints. However, as much as I want to help and fill out these questionnaires, all the responses will always be the same: 5 stars and will DEFINITELY recommend Druva to peers, acquaintances, etc. With that said, can they be sent out randomly instead of sending these feedback messages with every closed ticket? I'm obsessive-compulsive enough to keep filling them out and not just delete them, but it would be nice to save a few minutes here and there when my response will always be: YOU'RE THE BEST ;-). If there's anything wrong, I will not hesitate to provide feedback.",

Phoenix Cloud,Enterprise,"The error code that was displayed took you to a page that said, almost the same thing as the error message but said open a ticket with support for the solution. which I did, their response was to reboot the proxy, and if that did not work report back. If that is the standard response to this error why not put that in your documentation. reboot the proxy and restart the DR restore if it fails again contact support. Would save a lot of time.",

inSync Cloud,EP,Do better.,
inSync Cloud,EP,"The response to support cases has been excellent. My feedback relates to the Druva inSync portal. I think the interface could use updating. For example, under the users section, the Name column has room for very short names only. Also, it would be nice if we could sort by column in the Reporting section without having to download the file.",
Phoenix Cloud,Enterprise,Great follow up to resolution. I know I don't have to worry about any Druva issues because if you guys don't know how to fix it you will find out promptly. :-),

Phoenix Cloud,Enterprise,"Amazing, as usual!! :-)",
inSync Cloud,EP,"From a technical standpoint, it work perfectly. From an ITIL standpoint, there are some challenges around the lack of user centric reporting. From the Phoenix side, I would really like to see a way to remove a backup from configuration while maintaining the previous retention policy on the existing backup sets. Other things appear to have been added to your product roadmap (InSync data in Realize analytics, Path based retroactive compaction, Reporting on if a user is current vs just the device).",
inSync Cloud,EP,the communication with technical support and customer is very important and should be persistent.,

Phoenix Cloud,Enterprise,"Vikram was there for technical and emotional support as we resolved issues. After identifying the problem we got to a point that required another vendor to get involved. Once the ""other"" vendor performed their task, Vikram was ready willing and able to jump back on with me and complete the necessary steps. Now we are back up and running backups nightly.",
Endpoints,EP,"Take feedback, especially when a bug is discovered more seriously. Just telling customer ""oh, well, i guess I'll tell the engineering about this"" is not good enough.",
SaaS Apps,SaaS,"Druva is a solid platform, just keep improving the product by adding features. Support is top-notch.",

Phoenix Cloud,Enterprise,"We are using Thick provisioned VM drives for our Windows File Server, and on the file server we are using the Microsoft Dedupe feature on the volumes. If we had known at the outset of using Druva backup that these two decisions were antithetical to the Druva backup experience, we would have changed them at the time and saved money. As it happened, these two things were not caught initially and resulted in us burning through our credits at a faster rate than initially proposed, thereby making the service cost significantly more over the year. Now that we know what to do to modify this, we can save some money and have better estimates on credit utilization.",

Phoenix Cloud,Enterprise,First time using the support portal. Was amazed to get a phone call so soon. As a Wish list it would be nice to restore sql server database files to another device. Our development box for sql server is running on Windows 10.,
Native Workloads (CloudRanger),Enterprise,Excellent response time and follow through with the issue.,
Phoenix Cloud,Enterprise,"You had a good product overall. However it could use some polishing up. 1 - For my NAS backup I had a proxy down (failed upgrade) and only found out after my backups failed. The system shows if the proxy is connected, but it would be good to be notified by email when a proxy goes down. Especially if it is configured as part of a backup set (actively in use) 2 - Your documentation says it support CentOS 6.x releases, however your online ""proxy upgrade"" feature is broken for CentOS 6.x (reason for this support ticket). It seems like your development process is lacking testing/validation on the CentOS 6.x platform. Beyond that, you have a great support team and fast response. Thank you for the prompt and knowledgeable support! Sandeep is especially knowledgeable in supporting the NAS proxy. Thank you Sandeep!",

Phoenix Cloud,Enterprise,Thank you for your support. We look forward to working with you in the future.,
Phoenix Cloud,Enterprise,"This was a long standing, albeit non-system impacting, issue. I think I had two or three cases open for it since it happened each month. I beleive each time it was ""the logs say it was sending"", then I would comment back ""is there a log that says it was actually sent?"", then they would say there was an update or hotfix coming. The timeline wouldn't have mattered to me, as it was only impacting one person, but, I would have liked a response like, ""Hey it's going to take 2 months to fix this"" which would have been fine. It just reflected poorly on our IT because we had to inquire if the email was sent, that it should have sent, and then when it wasn't, we looked... not great. Again, this is the smallest of small issues, I just think communication or general understanding communicated to us could be improved.",

Endpoints,EP,"Druva Cloud vs. Druva Gov Cloud... that drop down box is so very often overlooked. Both on the clients themselves and as I did on the client download page. I don't have a solution, but wish there was a better way of making that choice more prominent. Perhaps something as simple as a comment in the error message when someone fails to logon. ""Make sure you are on the right server be it InSync cloud, GovCloud or on premise."" Or maybe break up the clients? One for Govcloud a separate download for InSync. Or maybe a configuration option in the setup program ""Is this to be a client for 1, 2, or 3"" Do users use more than one cloud on a single device?",

SaaS Apps,SaaS,good job,
Endpoints,EP,"I am not a fan of the recent changes to the Admin interface. I don't like that device operations are split out into two separate sections. Disable / Delete are reparaged from Decommission / Hold / etc. When I bring up a person then look at a device, I want to see all functions for the device. Not navigage to separe sections to get to what I need. This lead the the problem of selecting deleted instead of finding decommissioned. The functions are separated from the device so it's not clear they are there.",

Phoenix Cloud,Enterprise,"Thank you for your prompt response. We look forward to working with you in the future. ----------------------------- My comment below declares that it has nothing to do with this response. I understand that the guide's explanation is written in plain language so that it can be used by users who use languages ​​other than English, but the guide's explanation should include screen captures and screen captures as much as possible. I would like you to include the figure. In addition, I would like you to update the video explanation to the latest one. Customers in the Japanese market (including my company, which is a sales company) try to check the guide first in order to understand inSync / Phoenix / CloudRanger correctly, but the Japanese version guide is under development. Therefore, the situation is that the original guide is understood by using the translation function of a browser such as Google Chrome. In addition, the translation technology of the browser has evolved considerably, and it is becoming less and less common to have a strange Japanese translation (English-> Janapnese) as in the past, which is very helpful. I think it is a problem peculiar to Japan, but I would appreciate it if you could consider it. Kouji Kimura",

Endpoints,EP,"Thank you for your prompt response and easy-to-understand explanation. ------------------------------- I have an opinion about the Discussion Forum on the Druva support page (https://support.druva.com/s/). Customer questions are difficult to list in this forum, so we ask ""SUBMIT CASE"" individually. However, we want an answer immediately, so we think that similar / similar questions may have been posted on the [Discussion Forum], so check the [Discussion Forum] first, and when there are no related questions, We are asking ""SUBMIT CASE "" to investigate. As our request Many of the questions raised on the [Discussion Forum] are ""What happened after that?"" Therefore, I would like you to finish the unfinished question. In the [Discussion Forum], there are cases where Druva support members have decided that advanced support is required, so they have moved to ""SUBMIT CASE"", but even if they have moved to ""SUBMIT CASE"", the user's question I would like you to post information to the extent that it is possible to disclose what the manufacturer has done and what has happened as a result. If you do so, we will be able to reaffirm that the [Discussion Forum] is one of the effective sources of information for us who use Druva products. Currently, there are more than 300 cases, and I think that there are many cases that can be effectively used even now, if not all cases are currently available. We would like to utilize these effective information assets, and we would appreciate it if you could consider the above measures. Regadrs, Kouji Kimura",

Endpoints,EP,"Thank you for your response. I apologize for the prolonged response due to my poor English. ### The following is my request. ### It will be if the Druva support system is possible. There are many cases where a remote session can be more effective than an email exchange. In such cases, language differences (Japanese/English) can be a barrier. If possible, we would like you to consider adding a person who can operate a device in a Japanese environment and a person who can talk in Japanese as a support member. On the contrary, our company is looking for someone who can speak English normally, but it is difficult to get together. We are aware that this is due to our problem (lack of communication skills in English), which is originally responsible for Druva support in the Japanese market.",

Endpoints,EP,"I truly believe you are having issues stemming from AWS timeouts that caused my problems. I used to be able to correct a Legal Hold that did not have a user assigned without deleting that Legal Hold. It seems convoluted to add a custodian temporarily to a different Legal Hold, so that they will now appear in the unpopulated Legal Hold. Then go back and delete them from their temporary assignment to the Legal Hold they have no association with.",

Endpoints,EP,Quickly isolated my issue and we have a fix.,
Hybrid Workloads (Phoenix),Enterprise,Girish is very supportive.,
SaaS Apps,SaaS,This case took over 2 months to resolve. And I am not satisfied with the way it was handled. Druva should have been more forthcoming to resolving this with urgency.

Hybrid Workloads (Phoenix),Enterprise,Olivier was excellent support!,
Hybrid Workloads (Phoenix),Enterprise,I am very happy with the support,
SaaS Apps,SaaS,"As an administrator found that I cannot request a password reset if I don't remember it and if the other administrator in the company is also unable to login we have to delete our instances and restart the backups from scratch, which I felt is very extreme to reset a password. If this could be made simpler it would be good. It's easy to forget the 12 character long password. Anyway, in this case the other admin who was away when I couldn't login was able to reset my password later. Found this issue (which looks simple) to be a bit frustrating.",

SaaS Apps,SaaS,In 30 years of IT work experience this is one of the worst support organizations I've encountered. Issue was not resolved. It became useless to continue the case. Not one single straight answer to be found. Technician appeared in denial about the reported problem or did not have the tools/knowledge to resolve the issue.,
SaaS Apps,SaaS,Shoeb is the man! Always helpful and amazing service,
Endpoints,EP,Great product and the support is always on point,
Hybrid Workloads (Phoenix),Enterprise,This case should not have been closed. I uploaded the customer input and nothing happened. This is unresolved.,
Hybrid Workloads (Phoenix),Enterprise,you guys always provide quick support and resolution. Thank you,
Hybrid Workloads (Phoenix),Enterprise,"Please fix the bugs I reported as soon as possible. Also, your user interface is not intuitive at best and not informing / misleading about backup results at worst. This is not a minor issue. We did not have an off-site backup for more than 10 days after agents were updated and jobs quietly died. Even worse, status was OK (green) when the number of bytes did not match db backup size. Call me at 647-571-3339 if you need clarification.",
SaaS Apps,SaaS,"Excellent job from the techs as always, just a small login bug that was resolved extremely fast without any extra work from our side. Honestly have to say that I couldn't be happier with the product and support.",
Native Workloads (CloudRanger),Enterprise,Awesome Support from Ian Wilson.,
Endpoints,EP,"Faizan did a tremendous job with our customer. They had concerns about the mass deployment for MAC laptops, but Faizan walked them through the process and options, and they were very satisfied with how easy it's going to be for them to do.

Endpoints,EP,Excellent service from Support Engineer: Minhazuddin Shaikh,
Endpoints,EP,Our DRUVA administrators have been advised to modify the setup on iOS equipment.,
Hybrid Workloads (Phoenix),Enterprise,The engineer kept the process moving along until we found a new avenue to develop the troubleshoot requiring a new ticket.,
Hybrid Workloads (Phoenix),Enterprise,"Portal search can be overwhelming, but your tech support associates are the best",
Hybrid Workloads (Phoenix),Enterprise,Thank you for the support.,
Native Workloads (CloudRanger),Enterprise,Excellent service!,
Hybrid Workloads (Phoenix),Enterprise,Some UI elements are missing enough information to know exactly where a reported issue is coming from. An example is: Backup job for PAWNEEAUT01 has failed. VM Name: PAWNEEAUT01 Administrative Group: Default Administrative Group Backup Policy: default_vmware_bkup_policy Job ID: 11690 Started on: Mar 18 2022 07:23:30 America/Chicago Ended on: Mar 18 2022 09:47:15 America/Chicago Error Code: 1 Error Message: Snapshot of VM failed. [The VM is in invalid state to take snapshot.] It would help to know which vcenter and maybe which proxy failed the attempt. another example: VMWARE Backup Proxy has been in Disconnected State for more than 15 minutes. Site: Default Organization BackProxy: DRUVA01 BackupProxyPool: Default Proxy Pool BackupProxy Type: VMWARE BackupProxy Disconnected For: VCenter Disconnected Since: 25min I have 5 different vcenters... which one is it? Support has really been helpful though :-),

Hybrid Workloads (Phoenix),Enterprise,Thank you for the timely solutions!,
Hybrid Workloads (Phoenix),Enterprise,Thank you for clearing this up.,
Endpoints,EP,"I contacted support just wanting to be pointed at some relevant documentation—something that should have been resolved in 30 seconds. Instead, I found was rudely be shunted into a ticketing system and had various emails and calls and now surveys over the next few days. I'm sure the people I dealt with were professional and competent, but overall the process was a waste of time. I had to solve the problem myself anyway. So not a good experience, it seems largely about herding people into processes that suit the suppliers agenda, not meeting users needs. Going forward, I realize that contacting support will be slow and indirect and should therefore be considered a last resort.",
Hybrid Workloads (Phoenix),Enterprise,Get your solution in the upper right quadrant in Gartner because Druva deserves to be on that quadrant.,
SaaS Apps,SaaS,Minhazuddin is extremely knowledgeable. It is impressive to see him easily answer all technical questions related to inSync without skipping a beat. He is a valued asset to Druva and our customers.,

He has shown excellent knowledge of the product and the issue, and very friendly and professional attitude, and he was able to solve the issue in very short time. Highly appreciated. Keep up the good work :)",
SaaS Apps,SaaS,You should resolved the issue within timely manner and it shouldn’t take months to resolve the issue. This is really bad practice. Even the escalation team were not able to escalate the issue. Communication should be better as well. I wasn’t getting proper update regarding the ticket or when the issue would get resolved.,

Native Workloads (CloudRanger),Enterprise,Both Engineers I spoke with were wonderful. Knowledgeable and patient with me (as I'd never done this before) and we were able to carry out the process I required with the minimum of fuss. Very highly recommended.,
Endpoints,EP,Web download of a backup is pretty slow - but - awesome support!,
Endpoints,EP,"The documentation for re-homing an AD/LDAP server is sort-of correct in the online documentation-- as far as it goes. It leaves out a LOT of steps. Once I was able to get in touch with the 2nd level service tech, he quickly walked me through a LOT of steps to fix the issue. I did take notes in case I have to do it again!!",
Hybrid Workloads (Phoenix),Enterprise,"Giri was able to find a root cause of the issue and determine that it was functioning as intended and called me directly to explain the proper function in a very professional manner. Again, Giri is extremely professional and prompt. Give this man an even bigger raise!",
Endpoints,EP,"Please provide more staff into the chat portal, chat is the ultimate support contact option, but it is useless if you'll have to wait almost an hour before you will get an agent to chat with.",
Hybrid Workloads (Phoenix),Enterprise,dashboards should alow for me to expand colums so i can see the full names of backup jobs for example.,

Endpoints,EP,Thank you for your supports,
SaaS Apps,SaaS,Thank you for solving this so quickly. The time it took to resolve was excellent!,
SaaS Apps,SaaS,"The technician's support was very good. Two areas which I would suggest need improvement are: 1) The process of opening a new case. You really need a clear button for ""Open Case"". The little ""Contact Us"" slider in the lower right corner isn't obvious. 2) A great deal of background noise on the support call. The call center has lots of overlapping voices, making it difficult to follow the conversation.",
Endpoints,EP,Marc and Jose did an excellent job. They were able to do the initial deployment and backup configuration with the customer within 10 minutes! Marc also has a knack for casual small talk during times when we are waiting for installation/setup to complete that provides a positive experience and makes customers comfortable. A great asset to have.,
Hybrid Workloads (Phoenix),Enterprise,Thanks to the support reps who assisted!,
SaaS Apps,SaaS,"Great experience, fast and helped me out perfect the first time.",
Hybrid Workloads (Phoenix),Enterprise,A* service,
SaaS Apps,SaaS,"Support as always is top tier. Fast to respond and very helpful. The only complaint, would be the last 2 tickets i opened have ended up being known issues being worked on. But nothing about these was in the Druva support portals, which would have stopped me opening additional tickets Thanks",
Hybrid Workloads (Phoenix),Enterprise,good product and good techs,
SaaS Apps,SaaS,"It would be helpful to have a quicker / more streamlined process for support when needed. This ticket took a long time. If this was a more critical piece of our system, I would have needed this to be fixed in days, instead of almost a month.",
Native Workloads (CloudRanger),Enterprise,"Ian Wilson provided his typical level of exemplary support on this case - communicating well, seeing it through to a resolution, and volunteering to continue the investigation based on my feedback.",
Hybrid Workloads (Phoenix),Enterprise,The Tech Support at Druva coupled with their software is what makes this a successful product. They support their product and the product works !,
SaaS Apps,SaaS,awesome. also thomas dinsen is awesome !,

Hybrid Workloads (Phoenix),Enterprise,Great service and follow up on tickets.,
Hybrid Workloads (Phoenix),Enterprise,"Very quick support, appreciate it.",
SaaS Apps,SaaS,"Support is doing fine but customer needs to know what had happened in the backend, since the issue that i was facing was there for longer time and once we contacted the support it just got resolved, so need to have an brief log on that. rather than that everything is fine.",

SaaS Apps,SaaS,"All techs have been excellent, but most are unable to answer fundamental questions about inSync without asking somebody else.

Endpoints,EP,When I called technical support the person on the phone was not the person to help me. Instead he had me create an account with the support portal and create a ticket. Then proceeded to tell me that someone will be in contact from 45min to 2 hours. Would have been nice to trouble shoot it right over the phone at the time. However the issue was resolved. Thank you.,

Hybrid Workloads (Phoenix),Enterprise,Appreciated Raj's Help in resolving the backup issue,
Endpoints,EP,"This was a proactive case. But they couldn't tell us why for a few days and it turns out the issue was a few days prior to the case being open. Because of the lag we didn't immediately put together that something we had done cause the proactive case. And because they had no details it dragged it out as well. Ideally in the future if the case would have been opened sooner, or some more details why it was opened been provided, it would have saved time for both us and your support engineers.",

Endpoints,EP,"Aaquib Mulla did a great job, and so did the customer service rep who fielded the call. Got a call back in short time and resolved quickly. Also responded to further questions.",
Hybrid Workloads (Phoenix),Enterprise,"It is very inconvenient that there is not a way to indicate a Phoenix backup content should NOT contain any NFS/external mounts, only local disks. Not having this will require much more detailed work on content rules in order to not accidentally back up multi-TB NetApp mounts on the client file serve.",
Hybrid Workloads (Phoenix),Enterprise,Was surprised to learn that if we back up an incorrect path from a server that it will NEVER stop being counted against our data storage unless your engineers delete the entire saved data from that server. This makes me very nervous about creating exactly correct content rules because if it's not exactly correct the first time I'm paying for data I don't really want stored.,
SaaS Apps,SaaS,"drop the minimum level required to enrol on MSP platform, its to high at present.",
SaaS Apps,SaaS,"Excellent support, very friendly engineers with huge knowledge and know-how-to. Keep the good support guys!",

Endpoints,EP,They way of explication and problem resolving good.,
Native Workloads (CloudRanger),Enterprise,Excellent support,
SaaS Apps,SaaS,The process was way too slow and had to be escalated to the Technical support director. Once he was involved things went quickly and the problem was properly diagnosed and fixed expertly. Previous support was lazy and unhelpful in their actions and diagnosis. The time zone shifts are ridiculous with some q&as taking 24 hours or more. It was made worse because not all comments that were added to the support ticket were emailed so I had to keep remembering to check the web page for updates.,
Hybrid Workloads (Phoenix),Enterprise,Engineer was awesome!!,
Endpoints,EP,The support engineer was very helpful and supportive.,
SaaS Apps,SaaS,Excellent support from Gagan. He explained and showed me what the issue was and how to resolve. Outstanding support!!,

Endpoints,EP,App aware backup service support has been broken. The tech has not been able to fix our SQL Server backups in several days. The backups started working fine but had a slowly increased their failure rate. Now the backups don't work at all. See Case :00210074 Communications/follow through leaves room for improvement.,
Endpoints,EP,You need to add MFA on your portal. We will find another solution in 30 days if there is no MFA,
Endpoints,EP,Vikram is a rock star!,

SaaS Apps,SaaS,"Exporting multiple users does not export PST, it exports individual messages. The rest of features are pretty standard across backup products like this one. Its hard to tell what users are using account licenses between shared, preserved, exchange, onedrive, teams.",
SaaS Apps,SaaS,Rahul has been very skillful and knowledgeable and patient in helping to sort this issue. Was a pleasure to work with him.,
Endpoints,EP,great product!,
SaaS Apps,SaaS,"Excellent products. Do wish some management and reporting features were better. For example, each admin can assign reports to be sent to non-admin users. But any modifications of this must be done by the admin who assigned them. Other admins don't even see those settings. Wish a global admin could be able to see and modify any reporting configured.",

I will conduct another test next week with ONLY the VRPT-SAN-TST02.VA.NRECA.ORG backups set, which backs up all the drives. The F drive should have started backing up under that backup set starting July21. The other backup set in this tickets ending with -Druva-UAD-Testing has been disabled.

Hybrid Workloads,Enterprise,"Sandeep went beyond my expectations and stayed with the problem until resolution. While this was a self-inflicted wound on our part (we had disabled the AD account of an IT administrator who left the org) I could not find where the credentials were embedded, much less how to change them. Sandeep was efficient in his work and identified the issue on the Hyper-V cluster, then worked with me to get those credentials updated. He stayed with me until one of the affected backup jobs kicked off successfully. Can't say enough about his skill and professionalism, especially working with me during the weekend backup window.

Hybrid Workloads,Enterprise,Derick was polite and professional.,
Endpoints,EP,nice rahul,
Hybrid Workloads,Enterprise,this fault caused us a very big issue. I appreciate everyone was helping to get this resolved but I would have expected an issue of this size to have more failover built in. This could have been very embarrassing for us,

Hybrid Workloads,Enterprise,Thank you so much for your great efforts!,
SaaS Apps,SaaS,"Druva support, or lack thereof, is a deal breaker.",

SaaS Apps,SaaS,"Thank you, excellent support",
SaaS Apps,SaaS,"In this specific case the support asked me to repeat steps I've already done by myself, which is just a waste of time. I always knew that importing the user manually is a possible solution, and due to ""time"", I've decided to clean this issue from my desk. However, we never found the root cause, this issue might return in the future with no clear best practice.",
Hybrid Workloads,Enterprise,Your support engineers are very knowledgeable and the turn-around time on cases is very quick. Thanks again!,
SaaS Apps,SaaS,Most efficient tech support,

SaaS Apps,SaaS,"Keep doing what you're doing! The roadmap features are needed, but when they arrive should make for a well rounded product",
Hybrid Workloads,Enterprise,This has not been completed. In this case the engineer had me work to clear a Checkpoint. The VM will no longer start so I need to get that fixed since none of the servers are backing up. The issue of the SQL dB not backing up completely has not been corrected and I have not heard any progress on that case either.,
SaaS Apps,SaaS,"I believe I have worked with Mr Singh before. If not, please forgive my memory. But he was excellence in every way...polite, kind, patient, knowledgeable, efficient, and he really cared about the issue.

SaaS Apps,SaaS,"Technician was excellent. Very knowledgeable and patient. I very much appreciated his willingness to ensure I had all information needed to not only correct my issue, but utilize the service to its fullest moving forward. Perfect support.",
Endpoints,EP,"I entered into a 3-year agreement thinking that the external link sharing feature of Druva was being sunsetted, not the sync between endpoints. Not that I know this I am pretty disappointed. While I didn't care about the file sharing and permissions between parties I have always made heavy use of the endpoint synchronization of files as I move across systems. So, I am not particularly happy at this time.",
Hybrid Workloads,Enterprise,"Support Engineer Olivier Tchuitio is excellent and Druva products seems great, but I have tried to address issues in the past where the process of getting a support engineer from Druva Support on the case when you urgently need one is to risky for our mission critical systems therefore Druva Backup will be replace at our company.",

Hybrid Workloads,Enterprise,A** support. Excellent,
SaaS Apps,SaaS,The portal did not address my question very well and did not indicate that it could be an issue on the backend. Documentation for this error could be a bit better and provide more steps for me to take.,

SaaS Apps,SaaS,We would like to have a little longer notice for big changes like certification updates. Perhaps 2 weeks or more.,
SaaS Apps,SaaS,"This case was executed in response to a Druva request to update our SSO. Once complete we found there were other changes included - and those were incompatible with our setup. Support still has not addressed - but I found a value for the SAML RelayState that allowed us to restore service. Unfortunately, I have no idea what this value means and if it might change again.",
Hybrid Workloads,Enterprise,Nice to work with you regarding issue time to take care everything with proper manner and explain all things related to issue. but take customer ideas to improve product features to easily identify the issues.,

SaaS Apps,SaaS,"I really appreciate the quick response. This was not a P1 issue, but I have limited time to work on issues. Tech called me about 15 minutes after I created ticket and completed the update in 5 minutes over Zoom. Thank you!!!",
Endpoints,EP,Would be great to have a way to track fixes on the way. We are waiting on a fix and have no way to track it except keep opening tickets to the support and ask for an update.,
Endpoints,EP,We consistently receive quality support from Druva. We are happy.,
Hybrid Workloads,Enterprise,Great support and fantastic solutions!,
SaaS Apps,SaaS,Thank you for being thorough.,

SaaS Apps,SaaS,Excellent support and service. Gagan is a huge asset to Druva. Keep up the outstanding support,
Native Workloads,Enterprise,"the platform is definitely getting better (Native Workloads/CloudRanger) however it still feels as though it is not quite ""enterprise ready"" as far as the management strategy - there are still features that are account-by-account (notification settings) that seem to indicate there are opportunities to mature in the enterprise space. Additionally, some of the failure error messages are not documented, which makes it a bit hard to troubleshoot.",
Hybrid Workloads,Enterprise,"My office lost power because of a construction incident. As a result the entire building was out of power. When power was returned and the network was back online, I knew that any issues I had regarding my backups, DRUVA would be helpful...and Raj was extremely helpful in making sure we were back online. In the end he had to wait for me to be free from my obligations but never gave up on us. He was able to help me determine the issue with our backup Proxies wasn't even Druva related but this didn't stop him from following up on the progress and offering his help. With his help we realized that VMware ESXI Hosts were not acting properly. So 48 hrs later, I am happy to report we are back to normal and Raj support by being there like a FRIEND, helped me isolate, correct and get everything back online for the DRUVA PROXIES which started working automatically without intervention. I always said that Druva has a great product but the people that support these products make it the best product. I give the Tech Support team 5-Stars for their ALL STAR Support team.",
SaaS Apps,SaaS,"Please see my initial feedback. (Related cases: 00210816, 00216375)",

Endpoints,EP,Thank you very much for your kind support.,
Hybrid Workloads,Enterprise,All great with nair he is familiar with my enviroment!,
Endpoints,EP,"Druva continues to disappoint us with ongoing issues. Recently Druva broke itself by updating clients on Catalina Mac machines that could not handle the update, thus stopping backups for a month. Druva does not have an .exe client, but continues to stick with the archaic .msi files. Terrible product. Would never recommend given the numerous issues we have had to work with, and clean up due to poor development.",
Endpoints,EP,All good thank you,
SaaS Apps,SaaS,As always support at a high level of excellence.,
Hybrid Workloads,Enterprise,"Tulika and Ian are rock stars they opened up a ticket for me upon first ask, Ian worked diligently with me to identify the servers for delete and then get all the tickets in place for the process. Where it broke down was all of this was passed on to Cloud Ops and they sat on the ticket for 12 hours and did nothing until Ian followed up and asked for action on the ticket! It was then completed and I deleted the databases from lab but this whole process for delayed delete is extremely onerous and complex and requires many approvals it has to be streamlined or it will result in issues particularly for POC's",

SaaS Apps,SaaS,The documentation is not clear and the account access is disconnected. I should be able to login Druva Salesforce backup using my Druva cloud admin account. No one should have to jump through those hoops to start a backup.,

Hybrid Workloads,Enterprise,Druva support was excellent.,
SaaS Apps,SaaS,"I opened this case due to a miscommunication from a customer, so closed itwhen I realized there was actually no issue.",
SaaS Apps,SaaS,"i can't believe the support case was closed when all I got was one initial response, an incorrect one, and then my next two messages were ignored entirely. The question was never answered.",
SaaS Apps,SaaS,"This was my first disappointing engineer interaction. When we asked what to do after the running deleted-only restore hung we were told to cancel it and restart it. This led to so many dupes the account was unusable by our customer. I wish the engineer had understood and researched what restarting after a running restore failed would do. When he later gave me other information about the behavior of date-span limitations I asked him to confirm his statement - he found that he again did not give us the correct information. He was very polite, but after the first incorrect suggestion I lost faith in his answers. Also, the linked ""resolution"" does not in fact resolve our situation of needing to restore previously-deleted items that are not in the latest snapshot, so taking a new snapshot doesn't help us. https://docs.druva.com/Knowledge_Base/inSync/Troubleshooting/Exchange_Online_restore_using_only_deleted_items_option_restores_duplicate_items",

SaaS Apps,SaaS,"Faizan responded within minutes of submitting a support ticket. he was very knowledgeable, quick and resolved my issue on the first try.",
Hybrid Workloads,Enterprise,Need a better search engine for the documentation.,
Hybrid Workloads,Enterprise,"every interaction with druva support was great. Wish we could have resolved the long running log job removal on the back end sooner as was asked to restart multiple times after I did this with the original tech. After the original trouble shooting session, I was under the assumption that engineering was going to remove the stuck job on the back end and it took several days and the resolution was to get on a zoom meeting and it took 15 minutes to run that script which then allowed us to cancel the job. Seems that could have been done much sooner as this was a LOB system that if we lost could have been very bad for me.",
Hybrid Workloads,Enterprise,Amin Baig and Giri Pillarigunta were fantastic support on this issue,
Hybrid Workloads,Enterprise,"I'm very frustrated with the sales side of Druva. It was a salesman that stated the setting was a best practice and would have no effect on retention. He also stated that he would open a case over a week before it was done. Once the support case was opened it went very poorly. It was made very difficult to get the ""authorization"" and then once that was addressed the expectation was that the issue was going to be resolved immediately, not only did it take several days but no one was ever able to provide any kind of time to resolve estimate, just kept stating that it was a priority. IF that is priority service I need to find another service provider.",
Hybrid Workloads,Enterprise,Akshay Nair was very helpful and his troubleshooting was top notch. Would love to work with him again when I submit future tickets.,
SaaS Apps,SaaS,Jabir was quick to help and was very patient when I couldn't follow up as promptly as I would have liked. Excellent service!,

Hybrid Workloads,Enterprise,I really appreciate when I call and learn something. Thank you!,
Endpoints,EP,"The use of the same client for multiple cloud platforms is a source of confusion. As GovCloud customers, our users often forget to pick the option when downloading the latest inSync client or attempting to re-activate their backups. They somehow overlook that the drop down menu is there. Maybe naming one set of inSync clients inSyncGov and releasing the compatible versions with GovCloud with that name. It is the same as InSync, I know. It might make keeping track of compatible versioning a little easier? Then there is Apple changing their OS on a Monthly basis it seems. Keeping track of which version of the inSync client will run on a Macbook is rough. You provide all the necessary information, it is just so many points to check and make are right. Okay so I have GovCloud, therefore I have a choice of these three clients, but my OS is Monterey, so actually only these last two clients will work. Smarter clients might help. ""This version is not supported on govcloud."" You do have it well organized, but there is always room for improvement.",
Endpoints,EP,"This ticket took too long to get resolved. For the first few weeks my time was wasted having the tech collect logs. It was clear that he didn't know what was causing the problem. It wasn't until a new tech started working on it that we were able to resolve it, but even that took more than a week.",
Endpoints,EP,Thanks Jose - job well done.,
Hybrid Workloads,Enterprise,Thanks for supporting us.,

SaaS Apps,SaaS,"We spent a significant amount of time in POC. Eventually, we decided not to proceed with Druva, based on the poor experience with Druva Support and the lack of communication/updates.

SaaS Apps,SaaS,Quick response and solution. Thanks Team keep -up the good work.,
Hybrid Workloads,Enterprise,"The technicians are always great at their job, especially Rajkunwer Singh. He is always quick to help and very knowledgeable on the subjects I need assistance with. ---- My critique is of the Druva user interface. It is clunky, for example some features like manage administrators. If you go to the drop down on the top of the UI with the gear icon, it says no administrators are there. To actually access administrators, you have to use the top left button and look all the way down on the list. An easy solution for this would be to decide on one location of 'manage administrators.' Delete the one that doesn't work. --- Unfortunately, the UI is not user friendly to people who are new to the product. Even I have been using Druva for two years but still have issues with very basic things because it is not intuitive for front end usage. When I started two years ago, it was a disaster I cannot lie. With all of these new updates, it has only gotten more confusing. Less is more in this case. --- That being said, I enjoy using Druva, and it gets the job done. The techs help when something is wrong, and the problem resolves fast. Excellent customer service despite interface issues, great product.",

Hybrid Workloads,Enterprise,Ian Wilson was fantastic at finding the root cause and resolution. Very efficient and professional. The customer was able to understand the reasons for the failures and was able to apply the changes to resolve it quickly.,
SaaS Apps,SaaS,It wasn't clear from communication that the backups were going to automatically re-start. Some of the backups had been failing for just over two days. It took a few hours from the update that it was backend error until the backups restarted.,
Endpoints,EP,good explanation,
SaaS Apps,SaaS,"Mahesh was responsive and continued following up with the case, thank you for the assistance.",
SaaS Apps,SaaS,Quick response and fix - I didn't expect the quick engineering turnaround.,
SaaS Apps,SaaS,Unnecessary ticket but happy you have a check-in when an unusual activity happens.,
SaaS Apps,SaaS,"patient, thorough, made sure the problem was resolved",
Native Workloads,Enterprise,To many issues trying to get this Storage to work and nobody has all the answers to what should be normal procedures such as why we are being told it will delete hundreds of backup file during migration of storage. The engineer was suppose to get me an answer and didn't.,
SaaS Apps,SaaS,The tenacity of the team in keeping up with this issue until completion was very much appreciated! Excellent work getting to the bottom of the issue!,
Endpoints,EP,Abdul provided me excellent support on this case. Really appreciable!!,
Hybrid Workloads,Enterprise,Make it easier to find the button for creating a new case.,
SaaS Apps,SaaS,"Excellent support, as always. Keep up the great work!",
Hybrid Workloads,Enterprise,Nagesh was very helpful to t/s issues with the POC customer. Not only he helped resolve the issue but worked in my absence to keep customer engaged.,
SaaS Apps,SaaS,"As a customer, it is not acceptable that a basic interface such as the Azure AD sync/import and thus the backup, generally does not work for several weeks. Since 08.01.23 the creation of new users based on an AD group does not work for BBC Group and other customers. According to Druva (via support) this will only be fixed on 04.02.23. As long as the customer had no backup for new users.",
SaaS Apps,SaaS,Thank you for a fast answer,
Hybrid Workloads,Enterprise,Excellent support,
SaaS Apps,SaaS,Good explanation,

Endpoints,EP,Service increase time line,
Hybrid Workloads,Enterprise,Quick and outstanding professionel.,
SaaS Apps,SaaS,"More detailed information about performance expectation, because that is very relevant when doing migrations a thinking about the strategies",
Endpoints,EP,Thank you for your help !,
Endpoints,EP,"There are quite a few bugs that we have encountered with the online admin portal. These really need to be addressed. I also do not like that we have to wait 5 days or so after disabling a backup set before we can delete the backup. I’m not a child. I don’t need Druva to restrict me in that manner. If a backup is erroneously deleted, I’m sure you could help us restore it. Making us wait 5 days between disabling and deleting is just an annoyance. This of course doesn’t have anything to do with this particular ticket. It is just an overall observation.",
Hybrid Workloads,Enterprise,Another wonderful support experience.,
SaaS Apps,SaaS,Need a native way to manage Shared Mailboxes,
Hybrid Workloads,Enterprise,Great session.,
Hybrid Workloads,Enterprise,"it took me a little while to find the place to open support case, it would be nicer if it is more accessible",

Hybrid Workloads,Enterprise,"First Class - super fast response. The Tech guys knew there stuff. Resolution provided to my problem. Thank you guys, first rate.",
Endpoints,EP,"Mahesh was great, best support help from Druva that I've ever had!",
SaaS Apps,SaaS,"Know its out of Druva's hands, but the M365/Azure Throttling is a lot to deal with. No statistics available as to predictive throttling to better schedule (stagger, etc) backups or reduce backup frequency that may result in better backup times (more things backed up) based on Throttle feedback -- GraphAPI kicks back wait X seconds before retry on a throttle per call (even per account/object in a call, depending) --- easy enough to take that info, temp store it - calculate the overall wait and apply that to predictive results.",
Hybrid Workloads,Enterprise,Appreciate your help,
SaaS Apps,SaaS,E-support is excellent and helpful in their support of the Druva Field sales teams. PRompt response.,
Native Workloads,Enterprise,"Great response time, appeciate the help.",
Endpoints,EP,very good support,
SaaS Apps,SaaS,Support team was never able to resolve my issue and the case was marked as closed don't know why,
SaaS Apps,SaaS,The faster resolution provided by the Engineer. Good Job Faizan.,
SaaS Apps,SaaS,"When we converted to SCIM in 2022, we were not directed to delete the AD Connector and move to the Key Manager. When we made the switch, we were not directed to have a tenant admin re-authenticate. After re-authentication it took two days to recover -- this expectation was not set. All well now; but I am surprised we were not directed to do all the steps at once, instead of having to fix each failure one at a time.",
SaaS Apps,SaaS,Abishek provided outstanding support!! Very professional and knowledgeable,

Hybrid Workloads,Enterprise,"keep up the good work with the support engineers, a couple years ago it was very difficult to understand them. my experience today was excellent and pradeep spoke very clearly and his instructions were concise and very helpful and we were able to resolve my issues quickly",
Hybrid Workloads,Enterprise,"Besides Druva's amazing software, it is their amazing Tech Support that makes me keep using they products and services for the last 15 years. Its always a pleasure to interact with techs like Olivier Tchuitio the support engineer who called my offices and didn't give up calling until I picked up the phone. Then he was patient until I accessed the network infrastructure, logged into his online meeting and logged into druva. By now a typical Support tech would have given up. But Olivier listened watched and then guided me to correctly configure my backups so that we are once again back online. It is a pleasure to always speak with Druva Support Engineers. One of the few companies that still call you back and have human interactions. You are 5 STAR All-Stars.",
Endpoints,EP,Informative,
Hybrid Workloads,Enterprise,Overall excellent,
SaaS Apps,SaaS,I received a call back very quickly. The engineer was very knowledgable and was able to resolve my issue.,
Hybrid Workloads,Enterprise,"I would just like to give some good feedback on one of your support engineers - Ajinkya Darekar. He dealt with our last few queries extremely well, very efficient and a real pleasure to talk to and work with. He's a real asset to the Druva team! Rgds, Geoff",
Hybrid Workloads,Enterprise,Portal is very limited. Many colums cut short the data making the view useless. I did see many changes to the portal but none of them are meaningfull to the customer at all.,
SaaS Apps,SaaS,All steps were talked through and explained clearly,
SaaS Apps,SaaS,Engineer Aaquib is extremely helpful in resolving all technical issues. Kudos Aaquib!!!,
Hybrid Workloads,Enterprise,"inSync is good but management UI could be better, quite confusing. Phoenix is complicated, I hate proxies and depending on another VM to backup VMs on your host, isn't ideal for BC/DR especially when that proxy becomes problematic.",

Hybrid Workloads,Enterprise,Abhi was great and professional.,

SaaS Apps,SaaS,I've used you before (even did a feedback video for your Marketing Department). I finally got approval to bring DRUVA to my new company and needed some assistance with setup. He did such a great job explaining the best way to go live. We're up and running!,

Endpoints,EP,keep on doing great work,
Endpoints,EP,"The product was not ""Updating"" because the version I was using for my new installs had been recalled due to a flaw. But Druva did NOT put out an annoucement. I had downloaded the version and continued to use it for all new installs. We are being brought into line with our parent companies proceedures and require change controls to be filled out for any modifactions to software installs. So we can not use the auto updater. I look for newer versions on the release date. Then download the current version. We then use Altiris to push the current version to all the users. If a flaw is found post release and no announcement is put out about it, I will continue to use the flawed version.",
Endpoints,EP,Sanjeev resolve the issue and helps a lot.,
SaaS Apps,SaaS,"support engineer was very professional and had good communication skills. Was able to resolve most of the issues immediately, this ticket was a combination of issues on one ticket, which I appreciated and he handled them all very well. the last issue was caused by our actions resolving other issues and it took a little longer to get resolved, but in the end was resolved. Happy Customer.",

Endpoints,EP,Good.,
Native Workloads,Enterprise,Your support engineers that we have worked with have been amazing! We stopped using your product because there is not a local/on-premise application that can be used to manage the backups. If internet access in unavailable backups are not accessible even if cloudcache has been implemented. Storage costs for backups are also a concern. It is more cost effective to use another backup solution because of this.,
Hybrid Workloads,Enterprise,I don't have any feedback at this time.,
SaaS Apps,SaaS,awful,
SaaS Apps,SaaS,I received a callback within 30 minutes of putting in a LOW priority ticket. He got me in a Zoom meeting and shared his screen to help me see what I needed to change.,
Endpoints,EP,Quick assistance provided. Thank you Satish.,

SaaS Apps,SaaS,"Aaquib gave me exactly what I needed today - he was quick, to the point, and got me where I needed to be. Thanks!",

SaaS Apps,SaaS,Excellent support engineer!,
SaaS Apps,SaaS,excellent support engineer!,
Endpoints,EP,So far it is taking many manhours to maintain Druva in healthy shape across our fleet. We're a very small company and spending 1hr+ every day in IT on Druva; it's too much.,
SaaS Apps,SaaS,Great support and great knowledge. Sharing of documentation is also great and the support engineers are doing great job.,
Hybrid Workloads,Enterprise,Great service & support provided by Kishore Wagh,
SaaS Apps,SaaS,Druva support once again raises the bar with super fast response and resolution,
Endpoints,EP,"We had a 'Critical' ticket that took weeks to get resolved. The way we got to the resolution was by trying something ourselves and confirming it with the support agents. If the support agents had known the product they are working on, we would have had an answer to our problem within the first couple of days. Instead, we had to ask very direct questions to get answers instead of the support agent helping us solve the problem we had. We are dissatisfied with this service.",
Hybrid Workloads,Enterprise,Thanks so much!,
SaaS Apps,SaaS,"This request was related to a commercial issue. We have experienced the situation that instead of a new tenant creation an extension of an existing tenant was processed in the backend system. The purchase order we have received reflected something different. In order to ensure that this will not happen in future, i have requested a report out of the backend systems, to check an validate if the backend system reflects the bookings as they should be.",
Hybrid Workloads,Enterprise,It would be nice if you could provide more rest apis. Having to manually click through hundreds of VMs to delete the final backup or change proxy pools sucks!,
Endpoints,EP,"A lot of the documentation is, unfortunately, out of date, or addresses topics that don't need to be addressed. For example: how to deploy via intune - your article shouldn't go into 'how to setup intune', just 'how to setup the druva package'. It's a simple process that the article made look SO much harder!",
SaaS Apps,SaaS,Support staff was very detailed with responses to my questions. Also provided a walk through with examples.,

Hybrid Workloads,Enterprise,Good Support,
Hybrid Workloads,Enterprise,Great job from Sudhakar as usual,
Hybrid Workloads,Enterprise,"The regular support portal KB seems lacking in detailed technical documentation, so I was told to open a ticket with a support engineer, which I did. During the call, I found out that the actual technical documentation is to be found by registering for the Academy, and then all will be revealed. I will check that out, but in short, technical content should be readily available.",
SaaS Apps,SaaS,You have an excellent support Team,
Endpoints,EP,"Thank you, Rahul.",
SaaS Apps,SaaS,My issue went unresolved due to a problem with the platform. I was unable to recover the documents I wanted due to several technical reasons. There is an inherent problem with the platform that I cannot view more than 3000 entries when browsing to find a single object I am looking for in a large sharepoint library. Restoring to the same location is not an option as my users are syncing this library with OneDrive and this would cause excessive replication traffic due to 75 copies of a library with 180K objects being replicated at the same time. Enhancements to the web control or a local client that can connect to the web snapshots is necessary to view all branch objects I would need to restore leaf objects in a timely manner.,
Hybrid Workloads,Enterprise,na,
Endpoints,EP,Support tech was great to work with. He quickly resolved our issue.,
Hybrid Workloads,Enterprise,thank you foe the support.,
Hybrid Workloads,Enterprise,Raj was excellent in his troubleshooting and resolving of the issue. The issue was resolved in about 10 minutes and Raj took the time to field my questions and explain in detail the answers.,
Hybrid Workloads,Enterprise,Support Engineer was prompt in managing the case and provides timely updates. To get the fix from engineering in hte short time frame was awesome.,
Hybrid Workloads,Enterprise,The documentation is plentiful and helpful. I think it will be easier to understand if you add a KB or an error handling method in the middle of the operation procedure.,
Hybrid Workloads,Enterprise,I know there is language gap as customer is Japanese but support team is patient enough to solve the issue. Thanks.,
Hybrid Workloads,Enterprise,"Druva is the best, because of the Great Products, Services and the Support Engineers.",
